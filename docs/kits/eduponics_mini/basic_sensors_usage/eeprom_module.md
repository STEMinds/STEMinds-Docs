The Atmel AT24C02 EEPROM is a memory chip that allows you to store data and retain it even when the power goes off. It is usually used to store user settings or other kind of configuration.
<br/><br/>
This great chip allows us to write bytes of information and read them later, no matter if the device rebooted itself or not.
the ESP32 has the capability to store files locally using Python but we thought that adding EEPROM could be very useful.

## Specifications

The EEPROM includes many great features such as 1 million write cycles and data retention of 100 years, but also:

* Low voltage operation
* I2C-Compatible (2-wire) serial interface
* Bidirectional data transfer protocol (read and write)
* Write Protect pin for full array hardware data protection
* Ultra low active current (1mA max) and standby current (0.8Î¼A max)
* 8-byte Page Write mode, partial page writes are also allowed

!!! Warning "1,000,000 write lifecycle usage limit"
    1,000,000 writes might sound like a lot and it's definitely is. but, in order to keep the EEPROM healthy we do not recommend writing on it using while or for loops in milliseconds of interval which means you should keep data when it's necessary and read it when necessary, use it wisely and you should have years of possible great usage with the AT24C02 EEPROM chip!
    Reading is not limited as much as writing.

## Possible applications

There could be many reasons to use EEPROM, such as:

* authentication, keep login information or unique data that you need to access on time when device is booting;
* things that you need to check if device rebooted (if it's rebooted, you'll lose variables that were in memory, that's where EEPROM is useful for);
* remember the last state of a variable;
* save settings;
* save how many times an appliance was activated;
* any other type of data that you need to have saved permanently.

## Software explanation

!!! Info "Make sure micropython-eduponics is installed through upip"
    For our Python code, we will need to import eduponics library, make sure you followed the introduction guide on installing the library on the ESP32 Eduponics Mini board.

The software library is written by Mike Causer, you can check the Github library [here](https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-tinyrtc)
<br/><br/>
In micropython-eduponics we have a class called AT24C32N where there are multiple functions such as read and write.
The first thing to do will be to initialize our EEPROM using the I2C protocol which has 2 pins SCL and SDA.
The SCL pin would be pin 15 while the SDA pin would be pin number 4.
<br/><br/>
Then, when we have our i2c object ready, we can initialize the EEPROM.
<br/><br/>
First, we try to read 32 bytes which should be empty. Then, we'll write "hello world" which takes 11 bytes.
finally, we'll read 11 bytes which is exactly the length of the string we've added which is "hello world".
