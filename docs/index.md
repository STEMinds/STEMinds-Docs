<br/><br/>
In this wiki platform you'll find all the tools, tutorials and guides you need to get started with STEMinds official products and kits.</br>
<br/><br/>
In the wiki we offer detailed explanations and code samples in an easy to read format.

## Official Github repositories

We upload all of our code and repositories to our official Github account. Although we do offer code examples here in the wiki, we suggest that users access the official Github repositories in order to open issue tickets (We hope you don't have any issues yet!) and read more detailed technical instructions.
<br/><br/>
Our Github account can be accessed here: [github.com/STEMinds](https://github.com/STEMinds)
