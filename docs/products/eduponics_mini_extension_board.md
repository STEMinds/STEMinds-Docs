# Eduponics Mini Extension board

The Eduponics mini extension board designed using ADS1115 for ADC support and MCP23017 for GPIO control with some advance functionalities such as interrupt on change and precise analog data reading, the board allows to connect extra 4 analog data sensors and 4 digital output devices with 12V support.
<br/><br/>
While the Eduponics Mini ESP32 board allows to connect only one pump and one soil moisture sensor, we've decided to develop a custom HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) to enhance the Eduponics Mini functionalities by adding extra 4 soil moisture sensors and extra 4 pumps.

## Features

If we use simple words: the extension board allows us to control extra 4 plants (total of 5 plants) at the same time.
<br/><br/>
If we go with deeper explanation, the sensors aren't necessary need to be soil moisture sensors or pumps, it can be any analog or digital sensors that needs to be controlled using the Eduponics Mini (or any other micro-controller), giving you access to extra 4 relays and another 4 open IOs (input / output) and extra 4 analog sensors control.


This is really great addition not just to the Eduponics Mini ESP32 board but also to other microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pi that needs extra IO pins or analog reading which it's lack of.
<br/><br/>
Here is the detailed features that the Eduponics Mini extension board can offer you:

* ADS1115 16 bit ADC chipset, precise analog data reading
* MCP23017 IO chipset, allows to control extra 8 IO (input or output) devices
* External interrupt pins on data change for MCP23017
* External interrupt alert on analog data changes for ADS1115
* 4 Relay modules with XH2.54 connectors, 5V-24V support
* I2C interface - only 2 pins required
* 12-24V output for the relay modules
* MOSFETs to control the main power and the power for each analog input
* Arduino, Raspberry Pi & ESP32 and other controllers compatible

!!! Danger "12V-24V are not the same as 5V input"
      The Eduponics mini has 2 pins one is used as 12V pin goes from the DC adapter to the relay directly allows the relay to control pumps that rated higher than 5V, the other pin is 5V which gives power to the ESP32 and other ICs.

      DO NOT connect voltage higher than 5V to the pin rated as 5V as this WILL damage your Eduponics extension board and/or your Eduponics mini.
      The 12V-24V are designed to be isolated and wired through the relays ONLY and are meant to control external sensors and modules that require such voltage.

!!! note "Default address might be wrong for first batch (CrowdSupply)"
    If you purchased the product through CrowdSupply on the first batch, your extension board might state "MCP23017 default address: 0x20" in fact, the default address is 0x27.
    But don't you worry! this have no effect on your product at all, just make sure to note the default address if you  haven't played around with the switches is 0x27 instead of 0x20.

## ADS1115 16-Bit ADC

The Eduponics Mini Built-in ADC works pretty well but for the extension board we've decided to use ADS1115 to increase the precision, the ADS1115 provides 16-bit precision at 860 samples/second over the I2C protocol, the ADC includes a programmable gain amplifier, up to x16, to help boost up smaller single/differential signals to the full range
<br/><br/>
A micro-computer like Raspberry Pi for example doesn't have built-in ADC (analog to digital converter) as well as the pins might be occupied or limited, by using I2C we only need 2 pins and using the ADS1115 we can add analog capabilities to boards that lack of it.

### Features

Here are some of the specific features of the ADS1115:

* Wide supply range: 2.0V to 5.5V
* Low current consumption: Continuous Mode: Only 150ÂµA Single-Shot Mode: Auto Shut-Down
* Internal oscillator
* Internal PGA
* I2C Interface

For the complete information, check the ADS1115 data sheet: [ADS1115 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf)

### ADS1X15 library

!!! Info "Make sure micropython-eduponics is installed through upip"
    For our Python code, we will need to import eduponics library, make sure you followed the introduction guide on installing the library on the ESP32 Eduponics Mini board.

Below is the MicroPython library to control and configure the ADS1115 functionalities using the Eduponics Mini board and micropython-eduponics library, in the following example we are going to use a single soil moisture input in ADC(0).
<br/><br/>
let's use it to to get the analog sensors data (both raw and voltage), voltage can be sometimes useful to create some other conversion techniques or use it for data collection purposes. We will configure I2C address on SCL pin 33 and SDA pin 32 as this is the pins the extension board connected to, then we will use the default 0x48 I2C address and set gain to 1 (default)

!!! Info "When reading analog, current will flow. When not reading - current will not flow"
    a cool feature we have built-in inside the ADS1X15 library is to auto-control the MOSFETs, when we test data through the ADS the MOSFETs will open, when we finish testing the MOSFETs will close. this allows us to both save power and use sensors together that otherwise might have a conflict.

We will read the analog data from the sensors every second and print them into the terminal screen.
<br/><br/>
For the Arduino code, we need to download and install the following library: [ADS1115 Arduino Library](https://github.com/addicore/ADS1115)

## MCP23017 16-bit I/O Expander

How can we control 4 relays without taking up 4 pins (excluding GND and VCC pins)? Simply use the MCP23017 I/O expander that uses I2C for communication (just 2 pins!)
<br/><br/>
the MCP23017 can control up to 8 IO ports: 4 of the IO pins are reserved for the relays those cannot be re-wired as input or any other purposes, for the other 4 IO pins we've made pins available to connect any other extra sensors. Except that, the Eduponics Mini also has available IO ports for use which are not taken by any other application.

### Features

All the MCP23017 pins can be used for either input or output and they even offer some advance features such as external interrupt on I/O changes, the complete feature list includes:

* 16-Bit Bidirectional I/O Ports
* High-Speed I2C Interface
* Control up to eight IO devices
* Configurable interrupt output pins

To learn more, feel free to refer to the data sheet: [MCP23017 data sheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20001952C.pdf)
