# Initial setup

## Pre-requirements

At this stage, we assume you've followed all the instructions and have a fresh Raspbian OS image installed into your Micro SD card.<br/>

## Connecting to your Pi

The first thing towards your Eduponics learning journey will be to setup your pi and kit to work.<br/>
at this stage, you have a fresh SD card with Raspbian OS image on it, let's plug that SD card into the raspberry pi zero<br/>

```

```

Once you've got that sorted out, connect the 12V power adapter to the DC input of the hardware kit<br/>

```

```

Now you should see the Eduponics kit turn on together with the RPi zero blinking LEDs.<br/>

There are two possible ways you could connect to your Eduponics kit, one would be using a wireless mouse and keyboard which if you have at home can be very useful.
another one would be using SSH protocol which is a little more advanced.
if you are up for a challenge and you are familiar with some unix commands and using [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) - we definitely recommend the SSH method.

### Keyboard, Mouse & Monitor

With our kit we've included an HDMI to Micro HDMI adapter and a mini USB to USB Female adapter.
those adapters will allow you to connect an HDMI supported monitor and a wireless keyboard and mouse to your raspberry pi zero and be able to control it with ease.
once you've connected them properly, you should see the Raspbian OS Desktop right away.
